Description: This package derives local minima and maxima based on a numeric vector and an interval period.  The 
   primary result provide these oridinal vectors and a complete data frame with xy coordinates.  Also, there is a plotting 
   function to visualize the extrema, isolate the reversal, and note the percent change from minima and maxima, and vice versa.
